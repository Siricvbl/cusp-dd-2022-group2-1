# CUSP Data Dive London 2022

This repository contains Group 2's contribution to the Centre for Urban Science and Progress London Data Dive 2022.
The group consisted of @samuelhoenle (University of Glasgow), @WilkesZhu (University of Glasgow), @Elika-Sinha (UCL), and @Siricvbl (UCL).

We tackled challenge C 'Correlations and COVID-19', which tasked us to look for patterns in England's open data about the COVID-19 pandemic.
The focus of our work was to identify policy changes that might have led to an increase in infections in early 2022, as London was recovering from the first Omicron wave.
The target audience were policy-makers deciding on policy changes after a hypothetical future COVID-19 wave.

Our work was awarded with the *Best Technical Contribution award* by the event's jury.

## Presentation
The main output of our work is the presentation held on day 4 of the Data Dive.
